# Salary Prediction Based on Personal Characteristics
This project focuses on predicting whether a person's salary exceeds 50 thousand dollars per year based on certain characteristics. We utilize the Adult dataset from the University of California Irvine for this purpose.

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains 14 predictor variables and a target variable, with a total of 32,561 samples. The target variable indicates whether a person's salary is above 50K (">50K") or below or equal to 50K ("<=50K"). The predictor variables include age, work class, education, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital gain, capital loss, hours per week, and native country.

## Project Objectives
The project involves several key tasks:

Preprocessing the dataset, which includes handling numerical and categorical features, dealing with outliers and null values, and transforming data.

Implementing various supervised learning models, specifically Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Trees.

Evaluating the performance of these models and selecting the most effective one.

The whole process is implemented and illustrated in a Jupyter notebook, which forms the main deliverable of the project.
